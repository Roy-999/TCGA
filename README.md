## Association of DNA Methylation and Lung Cancer Histological Subtypes

### Project Summary
The research delves into the detection of lung cancer subtypes, LUAD and LUSC, through DNA methylation beta values from CpG sites. It emphasizes the challenges in identifying LUAD due to its peripheral lung location, typically requiring invasive biopsies. The study leverages whole genome sequencing of CpG sites to develop a non-invasive blood marker-based approach for cancer detection. This work sets the foundation for further clinical validation and broader application in cancer diagnostics.
